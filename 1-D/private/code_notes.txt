These notes are for homework assignment CA 01 for Mat228a

The executable is ca1.x

The source program file is ca1.f

The module files are denoted [name]_m.f

The module object ".o" files are denoted [name]_m.o

The module .mod files are named similarly

The code should be able to be run with the command "./ca1.x"

Right now the code will run all three numerical methods with m = 2^6 to
m = 2^16.  This takes on the order of five to seven hours. The loops in
ca1.f can be modified to change the discretizations, but the discretizations
are hard coded into fd_methods_m.f and some dissection of the code will
need to be done to make the correct changes, should one desire different
analysis parameters.

There is no makefile, but the object files are created with the command: 

     gfortran -c fd_methods_m.f

for example.  There is some hierarchy associated with which object
file to compile first due to the USE association in each module.

The executable was created with the command:

     gfortran ca1.f fd_methods_m.o initial_conds_m.o norms_m.o -o ca1.x

To run the code successfully, certain directories need to be created
in order for the output to be written.

The following directories are to be placed in the same directory as the 
executable and module files, etc.:

    output
    norms

Within the output directory there needs to be the following directory

    output/exact_plots

A bash script entitled "plot_data.sh" is in the output directory, which 
outputs numerical method plots in the output/plots directory.  The code
automatically writes exact data to the output/exact_plots directory, but
currently there is no script to plot just the exact solution data.

Within the "norms" directory, there need to be the following directories:

    norms/plots
    norms/convergence_data

and within the convergence_data directory, there is the following directory:

    norms/convergence_data/excel

In the "norms" directory, there is an executable entitled "norm_processing.x"
This can be run with the following command:

    ./norm_processing.x

This processes the norm data up to l = 12.  The output is output to:

    norms/convergence_data/excel

For each file in this directory, the first column is the value of H,
the second column is the one norm, the third column is the one norm
rate of convergence, the fourth column is the 2 norm, the fifth column
is the rate of convergence in the 2 norm, the sixth column is the inf norm
and the last column is the rate in this norm.  The files are labeled

    lw1_.... for the lax-wendroff method for initial conditions 1
    upwind3_....for the upwind method for initial conditions 3
    etc.

The bash script "convergence_plots.sh" in the "norms" directory can be
run to create convergence plots that are located in norms/plots.

This post-processing system is not the most elegant so I can definitely
help anyone trying to run my code.
